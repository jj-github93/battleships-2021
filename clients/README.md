# Battleships Game Client

Game client code for distributed battleships using gRPC. 

The reference implementation can be used to see how it works. 

## Adding a new client

If you're adding a new client, make sure to do so in a new directory. Don't change anything
in the reference folder, unless you're actually improving that! 

## Runs within the Terminal

All actions are run through the terminal. User's add ships using entered coordinates, indicating 
orientation the ships. Game board can also be viewed within the terminal. This is all handled within the 
game handling python file (game_handling.py).
